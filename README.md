In this repo I put some useful codes that I developed during the time. THey are useful for Computer Vision purposes.

# Train_with_TensorFlow_DataGenerator
In this code I have trained a very simple NN with TensorFlow and by the help of Generator concept. 
The input data are downloaded from fashion_mnist in TF datasets.
